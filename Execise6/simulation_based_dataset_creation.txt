1. Simulation Parameters
Types of vehicles:
- Cars
- Trucks
- Buses
- Trams
- Motorcycles
- E-bikes and scooters

Types of roads:
- Main roads
- Secondary roads
- One-way streets
- Roundabouts
- Pedestrian zones
- Single-lane and multi-lane roads

Traffic signals and other control devices:
- Traffic lights
- Road signs

Road congestion (found online):
- Morning peak hours (7:00 - 9:00)
- Daytime (9:00 - 17:00)
- Evening peak hours (17:00 - 19:00)
- Nighttime (19:00 - 7:00)

2. City model creation:
- Generate a city map with all types of roads.
- Place traffic lights and road signs at intersections, pedestrian crossings, and areas near schools, kindergartens, and parks.
- Generate zones with different types of buildings (residential, commercial, industrial, landmarks).

Traffic simulation:
- Define routes for various types of public transport.
- Determine vehicle behavior (speed, distance, behavior at intersections).
- Consider the impact of traffic lights and signs on movement.

Time of day scenarios:
- Simulate changes in traffic density depending on the time of day.
- Consider various events (accidents, road repairs, weather conditions) and their probability at different times.

3. Data Collection and Utilization
Data types:
- Number of vehicles on certain road sections at different times.
- Average speed on certain road sections.
- Waiting time at traffic lights.
- Number of traffic violations.
- Travel time from one point to another.

Applications:
- Traffic management: Optimize traffic light settings to reduce congestion,
develop strategies to respond to accidents and incidents, plan measures to improve road capacity.
- Urban planning: Analyze current infrastructure and plan new roads or expansions,
assess the impact of new construction projects on traffic, develop zones with traffic
restrictions to improve urban environments.
- Public transport: Optimize routes and schedules, increase accessibility and attractiveness for residents.
- Environmental analysis: Assess vehicle emissions based on traffic conditions,
develop measures to reduce air pollution and improve environmental conditions.
